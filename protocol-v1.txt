All messages are prefixed with a 4-byte little-endian unsigned rest-of-message byte length (e.g. the 4-byte length is not itself included in the byte count).
The next byte is a message type.
0: name assignment (server -> client)

64: chat message (client -> server: does not include name; server -> client: includes name)
65: chat message error notification (server -> client)

128: name change request (client -> server)
129: name change approval (server -> client)
130: name change denial (server -> client)

255: disconnect notification (either)

All text/names/messages should be valid UTF-8
